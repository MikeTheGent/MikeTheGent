- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MikeTheGent
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in microcontrollers, particularly ESP32.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently using PlatformIO & VS Code, and experimenting with the different ways ESP32s can communicate with each other.

- I'm a retired software engineer. I didn't write any code for about 15 years, then came back to it. C++ seems to have changed a lot in the time
I was away. I also wrote a lot of Java back in the day, and started learning Python.
